# M.I.T. Frontend Application

The M.I.T. Frontend Application is a functional React-based web application that serves as the frontend for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). This application allows users to perform various actions, including logging in, registering as a new user, updating their profiles, and managing their transactions.

## Features

- **Login:** Users can log in using their registered email and password. The application validates the credentials and provides appropriate feedback for successful login or invalid credentials.

- **Registration:** New users can register by providing their name, email, password, and password confirmation. The application verifies the uniqueness of the email before creating a new user account.

- **Profile View:** After successful login, users can view their profile information, including the user's profile picture (avatar), name, email address, and current account balance.

- **Transactions:** Users can perform various types of transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals. The application keeps track of the user's transaction history and displays it on the profile screen.

- **Profile Update:** Logged-in users can update their profile information, including their name, email address, password, and profile picture (avatar).
